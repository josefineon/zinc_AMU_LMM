# zinc_AMU_LMM

This script is provided in relation to the data analysis described in Section 2.5 of the Methods section of the article: The effect of the discontinued use of zinc oxide on antimicrobial usage in Danish pig farms (published in Preventive Veterinary Medicine).

The primary objective of the analysis, described in the article, was to quantify the effect of the nationwide ban on zinc oxide usage, as well as the influence of individual farms and veterinarians, on farm-level AMU.

The script is shared to facilitate transparency, ensure reproducibility, and make the methodology accessible.

The data provided with this script has been anonymized to ensure compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Specifically, all farm characteristics have been removed, and farm and vet ID numbers have been altered to protect confidentiality.

While the results from this version may not match exactly with those in the article, due to the removal of structural fixed effects from the linear mixed-effects model, the script remains consistent with the methodology outlined in the article.

Generative AI tools have been applied in the development of this script.
